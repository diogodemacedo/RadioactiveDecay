    "**Radioactive decay** is the process by which an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by emitting radiation in the form of particles or electromagnetic waves. This physical process occurs in isotopes that have an imbalance of protons and neutrons in their nucleus, making it unstable. As a consequence, the unstable nucleus udnergoes a transformation into a different nucleus with a lower energy state and a more stable configuration. \n",
    "There are three types of radioactive decay:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Alpha-Decay**: An $\\alpha$ particle, which consists of two protons and two neutrons, is emitted from the nucleus.\n",
    "* **Beta-Decay**: A neutron in the nucleus is converted into a proton and an electron. The electron is consequently emitted from the nucleus int the form of a $\\beta$ particle.\n",
    "* **Gamma-Decay**: The nucleus releases excess energy in the form of high-energy photons, referred to as $\\gamma$-rays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Radioactive decay plays a fundamental role in many natural processes, such as nuclear energy production and radioactive dating. The main cons associated with this process are the possible health hazards that occur if the emitted radiation is not properly controlled or shielded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now express the radioactive decay process mathematically. Given a sample of a particular radioisotope, the number of decay events, $âˆ’dN$, expected to occur in an infinitesimally small time interval, $dt$, is proportional to the number of atoms present, $N$, that is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "-\\frac{dN}{dt} \\propto N\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the negative sign simply indicates that $N$ is decreasing as time increases. Introducing now the decay proportionality constant, $\\lambda$, which depends on the radioactive isotope and determines the rate at which it decays, it comes that:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "-\\frac{dN}{dt} = \\lambda N\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
